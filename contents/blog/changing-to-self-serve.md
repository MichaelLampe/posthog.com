The longer your strategy gets, the more useless it becomes.

At PostHog, we therefore communicate strategy as 'Nail X', where X is the thing we need to nail. It's simple and effective.

We [recently switched](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/3395) from Nail Enterprise to Nail Self Serve. This walks you through the previous context, and why we made that change.

## Why did we focus on Nail Enterprise in the first place?

The best products are generally built for end users.

The game we're playing isn't to please C-level executives or procurement - we want an engineer in any size organization on Earth to be able to use our software in production without getting up from their desk. If they work at a larger company, and if we provide them with a great experience, they'll share the platform with their peers, and will probably want to upgrade to one of our [paid offerings](/pricing). Our open source and free user base is our sales team.

Our original go to market plan was therefore a little like this:

1. get our open source project to product market fit
1. get a paid mid-size (~$20K-$40K a year) product to product market fit
1. get a paid large-size ($200K+ a year) product to product market fit

It took us until last Summer to get the open source product to feel successful. It became a lot less buggy, easier to deploy, much fuller featured and more scalable. As a result, we saw our inbound growth increasing and our retention improving.

We then focussed on getting 5 reference customers. It turned out, we had to [Nail Funnels](new-vp-nailing-funnels) to do this.

## What changed?

Things went much better than we thought. For the last 6 months, our paid products have averaged 20% month over month revenue growth - that's an 8.9x increase per year (for context - [3x is considered great](https://twitter.com/nimaroohis/status/1525970172237991939?s=21&t=qzYbxjpPbHlPZ7Xjus_PUA)). 

Three things combined caused this:

* we were able to get larger (generally, up to $70k) deals than we expected
* we made it easier to _pay_ for our paid product, which [led to more deals](pricing-lessons) that we expected
* we had more existing customer growth than we expected

Then we noticed something else.

Some customers are very fast (a couple of weeks, or less) to sell to, with minimal interaction, whereas others take months and are very intense. In fact, almost none of the customers that have put us through a big buying process have in fact converted to revenue yet.

## What does Nail Self Serve mean?

So we should do more of what's working.

For product, this means:

* 

For go to market, this means:

* Customer Success: Focus on time to revenue (for example, one of our Customer Success team's key results is volume of deals in our target range per week - rather than trying to hit an overall revenue figure)
* Marketing: Accelerate word of mouth growth
* Website and Docs: Make community self serve (for example, [make our _docs_](https://squeak.posthog.com) rather than Slack the main support channel)

## What do we think the future holds?

Today, we're very good at serving large mid market B2B companies who can buy quickly (through self serving).



We think the future of our revenue will come from enterprise.
